# FaceTune

FaceTune is a web application developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
It allows users to generate a personalized avatar by selecting skin color, hair color, eyes color, haircut, nose shape and mouth shape. 
Based on the chosen characteristics, the application generates a customized jingle for the avatar, allowing customization of tonality, speed, duration, harmonic progression, and melody.

Once the avatar is created, the application enables users to download the jingle and  it saves the created avatar in the "Avatar Community."
Within the avatar community, users can view all the previously created avatars, listen to their jingles, and rate them on a scale from 1 to 5.
