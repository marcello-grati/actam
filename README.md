# FaceTune

FaceTune is a web application developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
It allows users to generate a personalized avatar by selecting skin color, hair color, eyes color, haircut, nose shape and mouth shape. 
Based on the chosen characteristics, the application generates a customized jingle for the avatar, allowing customization of tonality, speed, duration, harmonic and melodic progression.

Once the avatar is created, the application enables users to download the jingle and saves the created avatar in the "Avatar Community".
Within the avatar community, users can view all the previously created avatars, listen to their jingles, and rate them on a scale from 1 to 5.

   https://github.com/marcello-grati/actam.git
   ```

   node app.js
   ```
3. Open the following link
   ```
   https://marcello-grati.github.io/actam/
   ```
   
NB: The previous mentioned link allows the user to open the application in a GitHub page but, 
due to the fact that GitHub page has default fonts, it modifies the original graphical layout.
If you want to see the original version of the application, run the code directly from Webstorm or VS Code.
